      <h1> Welcome to my website!</h1>
         <p> So this is a website that I've built for Launchcode!
            <br> I would love to use this opportunity to both talk about myself as well as learn in the process.</p>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>So I wanted to speak briefly abput my backround. 
         <br>
      I didn't go to college and spent the start of my adult life working without a goal. I started out working at a family friend's restaraunt, washing dishes and learning about myself. When I decided to move out I realized that I should get a better paying job, and so I started working in warehouses. It took a few years but I realized that I would like to lead, and that I think I have the mentality for it! Due in large part to my work ethic, I was promoted rather quickly after speaking my interest, and I very quickly proved to myself, my peers, and to my management team that I was right in my assumption.
      </p>
      <h3>Goals</h3>
      <p></p>I'm using this website as an opportunity to restate some of my thoughts and aspirations surrounding shifting my career path so drastically. With this I intend to reinforce and reinvigorate my drive to keep learning after this course is over.  
      <dl>My Goals:</dl>
         <dt>Land an apprenticeship!</dt>
            <dd>-</dd>
            <dd>-</dd>
         <dt>Use my knowledge gained to leverage myself into a job in software development</dt>
            <dd>-</dd>
            <dd>-</dd>
         <dt>Shift my career path towards Project Management.</dt>
            <dd>-While working in software development, I will want to apply to Google's free courses for a chance to get both that course and a Google cert. behind me.</dd>
            <dd>-</dd>
      <h4>Closing</h4>
      <p>At this juncture though I feel as if I have a much better understanding than I did at the start, and am super excited to continue my education. 

        Btw, &lt &amp &gt are great uses of our HTML entities but maybe hard to incorporate normally in conversation.
